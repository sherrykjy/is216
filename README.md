# Mario Univer-CT
Welcome to Mario Univer-CT where we will be here to assist your learning of COR-IS1702, Computational Thinking. Computational Thinking is coined as one of the hardest IS modules in SMU due to its steep learning curve given the complexity of content covered in the course. 


Mario Univer-CT is created due to the heavy workload from pre-class preparation such as the in-class exercises and pre-recorded lectures to watch. The objective of Mario Univer-CT is to reduce the steep learning curve and to providing support to promote independent learning

# Features!
Our application supports the following:
1. Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer
2. Practice Questions
3. Pre-recorded lectures 

## Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path
2. Depth-first Search (unweighted): a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path
3. RANDOM MAZE GENERATOR: Will generate a wall around the map randomly


HOW-TO:
1. Wait for the walls to be fully loaded
2. Select tutorial
3. Move Mario and Princess Peachy to wherever you like
4. Select Dijkstra OR Depth-first Search (DFS) 
5. The Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer will be triggered based on the selected algorithm


## Practice Questions
Consists of: 


1. COUNTING
2. COMPLEXITY
3. ITERATION

HOW-TO: 
1. Choose a chapter
2. Pick the right answer
3. If answer is wrong, it will appear red and the solution will appear
4. If answer is correct, it will appear green
5. At the end of the quiz, it will display your final score and you will have an option to try.
6. GOOD LUCK!

## Pre-recorded lectures
Youtube DATA API V3 is used to extract the playlist of pre-recorded lecture videos for students to watch it conveniently without having to toggle back to youtube. 

A search feature to search for a particular professor or topics. 


Youtube playlist taken from: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTzqoybeq893ko72GFYb0pA 

HOW-TO: 
1. Once the page is fully loaded, it will display all of the videos from the channel. 
2. Select the video you want if not, you can use the search feature to find:


a. the topic (E.g mergesort)


b. the professor (E.g Vivien)


c. Mid-terms or finals (E.g mid-term)


P.S Due to the limiting quota on the number of queries search per day, the max result displayed will only be 10.

## Setting up
1. On the new terminal of the folder, ENTER npm run serve. (Install npm if needed.)
2. Enter the local server.
If permission denied, ENTER:


rm -rf node_modules/


THEN:


npm install
  
  
THEN:


npm run serve
