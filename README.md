# Mario Univer-CT
Welcome to Mario Univer-CT where we will be here to assist your learning of COR-IS1702, Computational Thinking. Computational Thinking is coined as one of the hardest IS modules in SMU due to its steep learning curve given the complexity of content covered in the course. Mario Univer-CT is created due to the heavy workload from pre-class preparation such as the in-class exercises and pre-recorded lectures to watch. The objective of Mario Univer-CT is to reduce the steep learning curve and to providing support to promote independent learning

# Features!
Our application supports the following:
1. Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer
2. Practice Questions
3. Pre-recorded lectures 

## Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path
2. Depth-first Search (unweighted): a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path
3. RANDOM MAZE GENERATOR


HOW-TO:
1. Wait for the walls to be fully loaded
2. Select tutorial
3. Move Mario and Princess Peachy to wherever you like
4. Select Dijkstra OR Depth-first Search (DFS) 
5. The Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer will be triggered based on the selected algorithm

## Practice Questions
Consists of: 


1. COUNTING
2. COMPLEXITY
3. ITERATION

## Pre-recorded lectures
Youtube DATA API V3 is used to extract the playlist of pre-recorded lecture videos for students to watch it conveniently without having to toggle back to youtube. 

A search feature to search for a particular professor or topics.
