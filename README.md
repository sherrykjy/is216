# Mario Univer-CT
Welcome to Mario Univer-CT where we will be here to assist your learning of COR-IS1702, Computational Thinking. Computational Thinking is coined as one of the hardest IS modules in SMU due to its steep learning curve given the complexity of content covered in the course. Mario Univer-CT is created due to the heavy workload from pre-class preparation such as the in-class exercises and pre-recorded lectures to watch. The objective of Mario Univer-CT is to reduce the steep learning curve and to providing support to promote independent learning

# Features!
Our application supports the following:
1. Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer
2. Practice Questions
3. Pre-recorded lectures
