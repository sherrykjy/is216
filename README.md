# Mario Univer-CT
Welcome to Mario Univer-CT where we will be here to assist your learning of COR-IS1702, Computational Thinking. Computational Thinking is coined as one of the hardest IS modules in SMU due to its steep learning curve given the complexity of content covered in the course. Mario Univer-CT is created due to the heavy workload from pre-class preparation such as the in-class exercises and pre-recorded lectures to watch. The objective of Mario Univer-CT is to reduce the steep learning curve and to providing support to promote independent learning

# Features!
Our application supports the following:
1. Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer
2. Practice Questions
3. Pre-recorded lectures 

## Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path
2. Breath-first Search (unweighted): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path

## Practice Questions


## Setting up
1. On the new terminal of the folder, ENTER npm run serve. (Install npm if needed.)
2. Enter the local server.
If permission denied, ENTER:


rm -rf node_modules/


THEN:


npm install
  
  
THEN:


npm run serve
